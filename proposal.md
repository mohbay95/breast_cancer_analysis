## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
Our role: Data science team developing an interactive dashboard for breast cancer diagnosis analysis.
Target audience: Medical professionals, researchers, and healthcare policymakers.
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, and early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Understanding patterns in diagnostic data can aid medical professionals in identifying key indicators of malignancy. Our dashboard will provide an interactive visualization of breast cancer diagnostic data, allowing users to explore feature distributions and compare benign vs. malignant cases. This tool will help healthcare professionals analyze key factors that contribute to cancer classification, ultimately supporting early diagnosis and better treatment planning.

## Section 2: Description of the Data
Our dashboard will utilize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains 569 instances with 30 numerical features derived from cell nuclei images, along with a target variable indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The features include:
- Mean, standard error, and worst-case values of:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Concave points
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension

We will visualize key features and their relationships to cancer classification, while enabling users to filter and explore specific variables to identify trends in malignancy detection.

## Section 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Research Questions:

1. What are the most influential features in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors?
2. How do different features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness) correlate with malignancy?
3. Can interactive visualizations help in understanding breast cancer diagnosis patterns?

Usage Scenario:

Dr. Lisa, an oncologist at a cancer research institute, wants to analyze historical breast cancer diagnostic data to better understand tumor characteristics that indicate malignancy. She uses our dashboard to:
- Explore the distribution of tumor features for benign vs. malignant cases.
- Compare the impact of specific features such as concavity and compactness on diagnosis.
- Identify key patterns in the dataset that could support more accurate diagnoses.
By visualizing these insights, Dr. Lisa can refine her diagnostic approach, educate her peers, and contribute to early detection strategies for breast cancer patients.
