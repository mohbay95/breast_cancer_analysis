# Team Contract

## 1. Communication

Team members will respond to messages on the designated communication platform (e.g., Slack, Discord, WhatsApp) within 24 hours.
Weekly check-ins will be scheduled to track progress and address any blockers.
Important discussions and decisions will be documented in a shared document for future reference.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

Each team member will have a clearly defined role, but all members are expected to contribute to coding, documentation, and testing.
Responsibilities will be assigned based on expertise and workload capacity, but we will support each other as needed.
If a team member cannot fulfill a responsibility, they must inform the team in advance to allow for reassignment.

## 3. Code & Documentation Standards

All code must follow best practices, including clear variable names, proper formatting, and comments where necessary.
Each feature or bug fix must go through code review before merging into the main branch.
Documentation must be updated alongside the code to ensure maintainability.

## 4. Conflict Resolution
Team members will address conflicts professionally and openly, aiming for consensus-based solutions.
If disagreements arise, we will discuss as a team and, if needed, vote on a solution.
If a resolution cannot be reached, we will escalate the issue to an instructor or mentor.

## 5. Deadlines & Work Expectations

All members agree to meet deadlines set during team planning sessions.
If delays are expected, members must communicate as early as possible.
We will use a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Notion, GitHub Issues) to track tasks and ensure accountability.

## 6. Updating the Contract
Changes to this contract require a majority agreement from the team.
Updates will be documented in versioned commits in the repository.
